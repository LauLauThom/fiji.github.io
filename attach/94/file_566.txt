1. From imagej 1.47f update to 1.47j, there are two exe files on Fiji folder.
The ImageJ-win64.old could excute the 3D viewer function, but the ImageJ-win64 could not complete the 3D viewer. The ImageJ-win64 need to install Java3D before running the 3D viewer at the first time.

2. After downloading the latest Fiji version and doing the update, it still could not call 3D viewer correctly.
