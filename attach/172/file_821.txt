Hi Wayne,
I have yet to fill out the code portion of autoItemActionPerformed and resetItemActionPerformed. Originally I wrote to James Norman asking him to expand the code. To date I haven't received any answer so perhaps he is no longer supporting the code. Since I needed it, I decided to expand his code myself.
I have it to the point that it works inside my ImageJ test bed. I use NetBeans to develop code and use ImageJ within NetBeans. In the end everything goes over to Fiji.
Within ImageJ Window_Level_Tool.java works and there is a popup menu with the 2 items from Brightness & Contrast which I need. When I press on the menu entry it reaches the action performed stubs, and now I just need to fill them out with real code.
Clearly for it to work in Fiji, I need the additions in the core code.
Thanks,
Ilan
